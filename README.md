# Weisfeiler-Leman Coloring Algorithm ###

Implements the Weisfeiler-Leman coloring algorithm on directed graphs with edge/vertex colors.

Built from the code for the Amenability Test by Christopher Morris (https://github.com/chrsmrrs/amenability_test.git).

We currently support graphs specified in ASP (clingo) programs. Future work includes supporting
more graph formats.
